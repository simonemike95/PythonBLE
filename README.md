Some of this example uses code I found elsewhere, although it was long time ago and I can't remember where exactly I found it.
If found again I will link here as I do not claim 100% of this code to be mine.
It helped me massively and hopefully it will help some others too.


Following the steps in main.py (search comments for STEP 1, STEP 2, etc.) you can easily prototype a GATT server to work alongside BLE applications.
You can also add/modify services, characteristics, and responses to commands in RxTx.py or by creating your own similar class.
